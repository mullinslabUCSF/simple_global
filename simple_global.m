%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This function performs a global, least-squares, fitting of equilibrium 
% analytical ultracentrifuge data. The function assumes that data have been
% collected at three different speeds in a six-channel centerpiece with
% three sample wells. The concentrations of the macromolecules can vary but
% the model assumes that the absorbance profile represents a single 
% sedimenting species. This type of analysis is most useful for 
% macromolecules known to be monomeric or for estimating the size of high
% affinity complexes. In general, this is a good first-pass analysis that 
% provides a sense for whether a macromolecule oligomerizes and how big
% the oligomer might be. Homo-oligomers should be analyzed by more powerful
% fitting programs such as Winnln, Sedphat, or Ultrascan. For heterologous
% associating systems, we use multi_global_kb2(). 

% OUTPUT VALUES %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% s -- best-fit sigma factor
% m -- vector containing the amplitudes and offsets of the best fit

% INPUT PARAMETERS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% datadir -- string containing the name of data directory 
% refsp -- reference speed for sigma factor (used to calc. speed factors)
% extens -- string with the data file extension (e.g. "RA1" or "txt")
